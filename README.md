# My last two weeks here

### What did I do?? 

And with this meaningful start-question, welcome to my absoltely beautiful presentation about, what I did while my student intership here.


### First day:

  - Tutorial of how to use Java (VERY basic)
	
  - I used a tool named "Greenfoot"
 	
  - Well, it was copy and paste most of the time, so not really that impressive


			
### The next three days:
  
  - I still worked with "Greenfoot"</li>
  
  - I hab a few task-sheets, I worked on</li>
  
  - I did things like reproduce a very simple chinese videogame</li>
  
  - The tasks were definetly more coomplicated, but I did all of them</li>
  
  - I didn't need that much help, so Karsten and Volker also could do their actually work...:)</li>

			
### Friday the 13th:
	
  - Literally NOTHING worked the way it was supposed to.
	  
  - I was supposed to do something with a LED-matrix and FadeCandy, but - as I said - it didn't worked
	
  - Then I watched an ONE HOUR video of what is "git" and how to use it one a basic base
	
  - Then I tried to actually use git. Well, guess what: it didn't worked. But after a few tries I got it working.
	
  - After that I decided to do this website as a base for my presentation of what I did. :)
    -> because thats something I'm actually capable of doing, 'cause I had a corresponding subject in school already.
	
	
### -> Well, that was the first week here.

### Monday:
  
  - I learned how to use GitHub (also the very BASICS).
  
  - I made my first own GitHub-Page and transferred my HTML-code to GitHub.
  
  - While I did that, Karsten and Volker tried to get to LED-Matrix to work, but/and...
		
		
### In conclusion:
  
  - I had fun and learned interesting and also exciting things about the company.

  - I had the chance to talk to experts and see, what the people here actually do.

    -> I enjoyed this student intership very much, I want to thank Karsten and Volker and I definetly recommend this
	to anybody, who wants to learn or to know, what it is like, to poragramm really important software and working in a
	market-leading company like this!

  
## Thanks for the atttention and have a nice day, everyone!
