	<h1>Hello, Guys!</h1>
	<br>
	<h2>Welcome to my absolutely beautiful presentation about what I did the last two weeks!</h2>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><details><summary>First day:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>Tutorial of how to use Java (VERY basic)</li>
			<li>I used a tool named "Greenfoot"</li>
			<li>Well, it was copy and paste most of the time, so not really that impressive</li>
			</ul></p></details>
		</li>
		<li><details><summary>The next three days:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>I still worked with "Greenfoot"</li>
			<li>I hab a few task-sheets, I worked on</li>
			<li>I did things like reproduce a very simple chinese videogame</li>
			<li>The tasks were definetly more coomplicated, but I did all of them</li>
			<li>I didn't need that much help, so Karsten and Volker also could do their actually work...:)</li>
			</ul></p></details>
		</li>
		<li><details><summary>Friday the 13th:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>Literally NOTHING worked the way it was supposed to.</li>
			<li>I was supposed to do something with a LED-matrix and FadeCandy, but - as I said - it didn't worked</li>
			<li>Then I watched an ONE HOUR video of what is "git" and how to use it one a basic base</li>
			<li>Then I tried to actually use git. Well, guess what: it didn't worked. But after a few tries I got it working.</li>
			<li>After that I decided to do this website as a base for my presentation of what I did. :)</li>
			<li>-> because thats something I'm actually capable of doing, 'cause I had a corresponding subject in school already.</li>
			</ul></p></details>
		</li>
		<li> -> Well, that was the first week here.</li>
		<li><details><summary>In conclusion:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>I had fun and learned interesting and also exciting things about the company.</li>
			<li>Personally, I also can say, that my programming-skills improved a lot, what I believe is really cool.</li>
			<li>I had the chance to talk to experts and see, what the people here actually do.</li>
			<li> -> I enjoyed this student intership very much, I want to thank Karsten and Volker and I definetly recommend this
