	<h1>Hello, Guys!</h1>
	<br>
	<h2>Welcome to my absolutely beautiful presentation about what I did the last two weeks!</h2>
	<br>
	<h3>And sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes and for the definetly not exaggerated adjectives I described this presentation with :)</h3>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><details><summary>First day:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>Tutorial of how to use Java (VERY basic)</li>
			<li>I used a tool named "Greenfoot"</li>
			<li>Well, it was copy and paste most of the time, so not really that impressive</li>
			</ul></p></details>
		</li>
		<li><details><summary>The next three days:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>I still worked with "Greenfoot"</li>
			<li>I hab a few task-sheets, I worked on</li>
			<li>I did things like reproduce a very simple chinese videogame</li>
			<li>The tasks were definetly more coomplicated, but I did all of them</li>
			<li>I didn't need that much help, so Karsten and Volker also could do their actually work...:)</li>
			</ul></p></details>
		</li>
		<li><details><summary>Friday the 13th:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>Literally NOTHING worked the way it was supposed to.</li>
			<li>I was supposed to do something with a LED-matrix and FadeCandy, but - as I said - it didn't worked</li>
			<li>Then I watched an ONE HOUR video of what is "git" and how to use it one a basic base</li>
			<li>Then I tried to actually use git. Well, guess what: it didn't worked. But after a few tries I got it working.</li>
			<li>After that I decided to do this website as a base for my presentation of what I did. :)</li>
			<li>-> because thats something I'm actually capable of doing, 'cause I had a corresponding subject in school already.</li>
			</ul></p></details>
		</li>
		<li> -> Well, that was the first week here.</li>
		<br>
		<li><details><summary>2nd Monday:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>I played a little with GitHub and created my first GitHub-page.</li>
			<li>I transferred my HTML-file as well as my CSS-file to GitHub and now this absolutely gorgeous presentation website is available under "mijokama789.github.io".</li>
			<li>We still tried to get the LED-Matrix working -> we didn't made it :(</li>
			<li>But instead I started to work on programming a very simple version of snake with some other students and azubis</li>
			</ul></p></details>
		</li>
		<li><details><summary>2nd Tuesday:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>I finished my snake project -> I got it working, but didn't now, why it was working, but with  a little help, I found the rreason</li>
			<li>We tried to get snake to work on the LED-Matrix, well GUESS WHAT: IT STILL DIDN'T WORK!</li>
			<li>But we were getting closer, in the meantime I explained my snake-solution another student, that is also here for a student intership</li>
			</ul></p></details>
		</li>
		<li><details><summary>2nd Wednesday:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>I tried really hard to get this ******* LED-Matrix working</li>
			<li>And: WE DID IT!!</li>
			<li>So I spend about an half hour, to play Snake on the LED-Matrix and to get a full green screnn [-> didn't got it :(] </li>
			<li>[Also I finished this perfect presetation website on GitHub:)]</li>
			</p></ul></details>
		</li>	
		<li><details><summary>In conclusion:</summary>
			<p><ul>
			<li>I had fun and learned interesting and also exciting things about the company.</li>
			<li>Personally, I also can say, that my programming-skills improved a lot, what I believe is really cool.</li>
			<li>I had the chance to talk to experts and see, what the people here actually do.</li>
			<li> -> I enjoyed this student intership very much, I want to thank Karsten and Volker and I definetly recommend this
			<br>
			to anybody, who wants to learn or to know, what it is like, to poragramm really important software and working in a
			<br>
			market-leading company like this!</li>
